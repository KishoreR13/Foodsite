         <p>Unlike any other barbeques in town, we serve fully customized dishes as per customer requirements. We pride ourselves in being the first barbeque that also offers delightful Chinese starters.
    
            We have something for all ages. Understanding that everyone’s preferences are not the same, we have prepared an exhaustive menu of starters, main courses, and lip-smacking desserts and beverages. We are inclusive in that we cater to the needs of different audiences.
            
            We strive to make Smoke Hub Barbeque the de facto restaurant for weekend dinners, cheat meals, family get-togethers, foodies, couples, corporate diners, and almost everyone who wishes to have a pleasant time away from the musings of the city.
            
            In a never before seen venture and for the first time, we have introduced VR games for both adults and children in our outlet in Velacherry along with a kid’s play area that has attractions such as Magic mirrors to enliven your time with us.
            
            Our buffets are something to look forward to as we provide Chinese starters in addition to barbeque starters – a delicate gourmet of fine quality and quantity.
            
            We have recently launched our BBQ Chromepet branch in Chromepet and BBQ Coimbatore branch in Coimbatore.</p>
